# Crypto Broker Platform (CBP)

In this platform the actors involved are the crypto brokers and his customers (crypto customers). A crypto broker is a person or small organization whose business logic is to buy and sell crypto or fiat money in his local market, obtaining his profits from the difference in the buying/selling price. We can also distinguish two common crypto brokers levels, those acting as crypto brokers wholesalers and those who deal with final customers. The key goal of this platform is to facilitate most of the routine tasks to run the business and even provide the necessary functionality to always avoid the loss of money in every transaction.
