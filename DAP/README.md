# Blockchain beyond currency
With the adoption of _Digital Asset Management_ within Fermat, the framework establishes two distinct branches and its interconnected platform sets, one managing crypto currencies that deals with different cases of money transactions and another one, starting with this platform, to manage transactions and services based on digital assets. 

Asset Characteristics

* They are created by an *asset issuer*
* They have an *expiration date*
* They belong to a certain *asset type* and *asset sub-type*
* They have an associated *meta-data* (image, sound, multimedia file, etc)
* They have compulsory conditions to comply enclosed in the *asset contract*, related separately to the *issuer*, to its *type* and *sub-type*


## New Identities
The new identities introduced to run the basic life cycle of a digital asset are:

Asset Issuer :: creator and owner of the asset. He "hashes" the assets meta-data and links it to a _crypto transaction_ of a small crypto currency amount to a predefined *asset issuer crypto address*, and by these conjunct actions the asset is *issued*.
Asset User :: is the original recipient of the asset. After receiving it (as a part of a distribution campaign for example), he can perform several actions later described in the available transactions for digital asset, but the most frequent could be the transfer to a _redeem point_ to exchange it for the product/service represented by it.
Redeem Point :: is the point where the asset is exchanged for the service/product.

## New Components
The use of business logic for digital assets and the new interrelations between the actors involved need the following services to be granted: 

**Wallets**
one for each actor: Asset Issuer Wallet, Asset User Wallet, Redeem Point Wallet.

**Transactions**: Issuing, Distribution and Reception of digital assets. 

**Issuing**: tools to create an asset: _Asset Factory_

**Redemption** : three possible ways: by the Issuer, by the User and by a Redeem Point.

**Appropriation** : possibility of keeping the asset and *appropriating* the inherited crypto currency amount (transforming it into its *nominal value* )

**Community** tools to linking the Digital Assets actors among them (Issuer, User and Redeem Point Communities)
