# Fermat White Paper

## Introduction

The Fermat White Paper is a work in progress. Since the project was out of the radar for more than a year there was no need to publish a formal white paper. In preparation to transiting to a fully open community, the white paper was re-written and reviewed. 

The first version was written by [Luis Fernando Molina](https://github.com/Luis-Fernando-Molina) and later re-written by Peronet Despeignes with major contributions from Philip Farah and other reviewers.

Here you can find a link to the [Latest Version](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bzq6JfsbkKrAUFAwWUNyNS12ekU/view?ts=56f6c013).
